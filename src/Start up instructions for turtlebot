You can run the robot in two different modes, decribed below.  Each mode will display the SLAM map and rad-UCL maps
teleop mode: Control the robot using the WASDX keys
to run: roslaunch radiation_mapping radUCL_Teleop.launch

auto mode:  Robot will drive itself using path planning and rad-UCL
to run: roslaunch radiation_mapping radUCL_Auto.launch


Important notes:
-Ctrl-C to quit the program.  Sometimes you must hold it.
-If you wuit out of auto mode the robot will continue running the last available command.  So the motor may keep running.
-You must restart the robot to fully reset the SLAM map
-SLAM gets very confused if the robot is moved or if other objects move (such as legs).  
-THe robot can only see obstacles at the same height as the LIDAR unit.
